#                         Register operations
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Registered operations can be three kinds of functions:
#
# 1. for operations with static duration, it can be defined as a function
#    that returns a list of commands, with the static duration specified in
#    the decorator
# 2. for operations with dynamic duration, meaning the duration is determined
#    at runtime, it can be defined as a function that returns a tuple of
#    duration and commands; the decorator should be informed with the option
#    `return_duration=True`
# 3. for operations that depends and/or modifies the state, the operation
#    function should take the state as the first argument (no renaming allowed)
#    and return a new state before the rest of the return values
#
# For example the following are all valid definitions:
#  @cmd.operation(name='my-op', duration=10)
#  def my_op():
#      return ["do something"]
#
#  @cmd.operation(name='my-op', return_duration=True)
#  def my_op():
#      return 10, ["do something"]
#
#  @cmd.operation(name='my-op')
#  def my_op(state):
#      return state, ["do something"]
#
#  @cmd.operation(name='my-op', return_duration=True)
#  def my_op(state):
#      return state, 10, ["do something"]

class Operation(ABC):
    """
    An operation is a callable object that produces a set of commands to be executed by the observatory.

    This block takes an observatory state (dict) as input and returns a tuple containing a new state object
    as the effect of the command, and a list of commands for the telescope. Each command in the list is a 
    string-like object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    state : object
        The current state of the observatory.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple containing a new state, an estimated duration, and a list of command strings.

    Notes
    -----
    This is a base class for all operations. It should not be used directly.
    state will be mutated by the operation in place, therefore no "parallelism"
    is allowed on the same state object.

    Examples
    --------
    op = Operation()
    state = get_init_state()
    duration, commands = op(state)
